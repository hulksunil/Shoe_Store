<h3>Some other notes</h3>

I decided to put a limit on the amount of pictures that can be uploaded to 3. It just felt like a good number.

I used node.js because I didn't know how to run a server normally. I practiced a little before
with node.js so I gave it a shot. I ended up doing a lot of research about node.js.

EDIT: I believe I could've just used an apache server
